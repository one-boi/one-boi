Hello there,

I'm just starting my coding journey.
Hopefully I will get somewhere with this and not forget about it
Maybe I'll even start some nice projects, who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyways, here are some places where you can contact me:
Steam:    https://steamcommunity.com/id/one_boi
Discord:  one_boi#9397
